## Problem Statement
Imagine that a friend of yours runs a non-profit organization around political activism. A number of people have registered for an upcoming event. She has asked for your help in engaging these future attendees. For the first task, she wants you to find the government representatives for each attendee based on their zip code.

Similar to the zip codes, the phone numbers suffer from multiple formats and inconsistencies. If we wanted to allow individuals to sign up for mobile alerts with the phone numbers, we would need to make sure all of the numbers are valid and well-formed.

The boss is already thinking about the next conference: “Next year I want to make better use of our Google and Facebook advertising. Find out which hours of the day the most people registered, so we can run more ads during those hours.” Interesting! Using the registration date and time we want to find out what the peak registration hours

The big boss gets excited about the results from your hourly tabulations. It looks like there are some hours that are clearly more important than others. But now, tantalized, she wants to know “What days of the week did most people register?”
